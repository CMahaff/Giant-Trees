I started working on this mod almost a year ago. It has been a blast, and I've learn a ton. Bukkit really helped me improve as a programmer. The source code for this project is far from perfect, and if I re-wrote it today it would be better, but I'm still proud of what I created. Thanks to the over 2,000 of you who downloaded and enjoyed my plugin! And thanks to the Bukkit Team, and fellow Bukkit Developers for helping me get where I am today.
